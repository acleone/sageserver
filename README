Note: I'm working on the computation node at the moment.  Nothing else is
really done.

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYJXPAWypGgb92QStJ19cW-29y4-hn5hi8oXMR-11TU/edit?hl=en&authkey=CISp9cQB
for a general outline of the server.

Setup
=====

1. Install twisted

2. Download and install mongodb-linux-...-1.6.5.tgz

3. Get the python drivers (and bson module)::
    
    $ easy_install -U pymongo

4. (for building documentation) Install sphinx (1.0.6)::

    $ sudo easy_install -U sphinx


Running
=======

Note: the client doesn't talk to the server yet.

::

  $ python run_compnode.py
  
And open client/simple_exec.html in a webbrowser (File->Open)
